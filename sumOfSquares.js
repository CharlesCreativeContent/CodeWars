/*
You are given a program sumSquares that takes an array as input and returns the sum of the squares of each item in an array. For example:

sumSquares([1,2,3,4,5]) === 55 // 1 ** 2 + 2 ** 2 + 3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 + 5 ** 2
sumSquares([7,3,9,6,5]) === 200
sumSquares([11,13,15,18,2]) === 843
Shorten the code such that it meets the requirements.
*/

//Answer//

let sumSquares=arr=>arr.reduce((a, b) => a + (b*b),0)
