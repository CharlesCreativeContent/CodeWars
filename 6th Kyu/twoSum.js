/*
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

twoSum [1, 2, 3] 4 === (0, 2)
*/

//Answer//

function twoSum(n, t) {
for(let i = 0; i<n.length;i++){
if (n.indexOf(t-n[i])!==-1){return [i, n.lastIndexOf(t-n[i])]}
}
}
