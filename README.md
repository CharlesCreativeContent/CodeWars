A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Currently done over 1000+ challenges and push 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
