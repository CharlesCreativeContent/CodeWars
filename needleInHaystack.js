/*
Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

findNeedle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
should return "found the needle at position 5"
*/

//Answer//

function findNeedle(haystack) {
return 'found the needle at position ' + haystack.indexOf('needle')
}
