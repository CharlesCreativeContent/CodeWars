/*
Write a function that takes a list (in Python) or array (in other languages) of numbers, and makes a copy of it.

Note that you may have troubles if you do not return an actual copy, item by item, just a pointer or an alias for an existing list or array.

If not a list or array is given as a parameter in interpreted languages, the function should raise an error.

function copyList(l){
