/*
Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

if x>y - 3 points
if x<y - 0 point
if x=y - 1 point
Notes:

there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

//Answer//

const points=games=>games.reduce((output,current)=>{
    return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0]===current[2] ? 1 : 0;
  },0)
  
//OR//

function points(games) {
return games.map(x=>+x[0]-(+x[2])).map(x=>{if(x===0){return 1}else if (x<0){return 0}else{return 3}}).reduce((a,b)=>a+b)
}
