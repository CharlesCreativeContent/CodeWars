/*
Given 2 elevators (named "left" and "right") in a building with 3 floors (numbered 0 to 2), write a function elevator accepting 3 arguments (in order):

left - The current floor of the left elevator
right - The current floor of the right elevator
call - The floor that called an elevator
It should return the name of the elevator closest to the called floor ("left"/"right").

In the case where both elevators are equally distant from the called floor, choose the elevator to the right.

You can assume that the inputs will always be valid integers between 0-2.

Examples:

elevator(0, 1, 0); // => "left"
elevator(0, 1, 1); // => "right"
elevator(0, 1, 2); // => "right"
elevator(0, 0, 0); // => "right"
elevator(0, 2, 1); // => "right"
*/

//Answer//

function elevator(left, right, call){
return Math.abs(call-right)<=Math.abs(call-left)?'right':'left'
}
