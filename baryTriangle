/*
The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices with the midpoint of their opposite sides. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the same point, called the barycenter or the centroid. Given a triangle, defined by the cartesian coordinates of its vertices we need to localize its barycenter or centroid.

The function bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang, receives the coordinates of the three vertices A, B and C as three different arguments and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter O in an array [xO, yO]

This is how our asked function should work: the result of the coordinates should be expressed up to four decimals, (rounded result).

You know that the coordinates of the barycenter are given by the following formulas.

//Answer//

let barTriang = (p1, p2, p3) => [+((p1[0]+p2[0]+p3[0])/3).toFixed(4),+((p1[1]+p2[1]+p3[1])/3).toFixed(4)]
